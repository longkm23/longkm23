- 👋 Hi, I’m Kirsten Long, aka @longkm23. I am a Data Analytics student with TripleTen and I have had an exciting journey using techical projects to learn different data analytics and coding programs. So far, I have done project with SQL, Tableau, and Python, and I am currently working on a project using Software Development Tools. I am eager to take these skills into the public sector where I can use big data to impact community health and housing access. 

- 👀 I’m interested in community development and building a healthier, safer world. 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to use Software Development Tools to build out programs.
- 💞️ I love to read, get outside, interperet astrological charts, cook new recipes, and build meaningful connections.
